### Research Highlights

- **Gradient-Hamiltonian vector fields** Machine learning enthusiasts know about *gradients*. Physics majors understand *Hamiltonians*. But few know about a special combination of the two called the *gradient-Hamiltonian*. Ben Hoffman and I found some wonderful new applications of the gradient-Hamiltonian by generalizing it to geometric spaces with singularities in our paper [Stratified Gradient Hamiltonian Vector Fields and Collective Integrable Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13656).
