### Research Highlights

- As a research mathematician I studied integrable systems in symplectic geometry, a topic that lies at the intersection of mathematical physics, Lie theory, and differential and algebraic geometry.
- My favourite research achievement is my paper on **Gradient-Hamiltonian vector fields.** Machine learning enthusiasts know about *gradients*. Physics majors understand *Hamiltonians*. Few know of the *gradient-Hamiltonian*, which is a special combination of both concepts. Ben Hoffman and I found some wonderful new applications of the gradient-Hamiltonian in geometry and mathematical physics by generalizing it to geometric spaces with singularities in our paper [Stratified Gradient Hamiltonian Vector Fields and Collective Integrable Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13656). 
- I've written many other papers with many lovely collaborators. You can find a complete list of my research publications and pre-prints on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lane_j_2.html).

### Teaching and Mentorship

I've taught 10 university math courses and dozens of labs and tutorials. In total, approximately 2500 students. I've spoken several times to the students at Canada Math Camp. During the pandemic I supervised an undergraduate research project that resulted in a paper.
