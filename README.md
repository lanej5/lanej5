### Teaching and Mentorship ðŸŽ“

I've taught 10 university math courses, led dozens of labs and tutorials, spoken in outreach seminars, and supervised student research projects. In total, I've worked with approximately 2500 students. I'm passionate about overcoming communication barriers and fostering deeper understanding of both challenging concepts and each other. 

You can find some of my past [teaching materials on github](https://github.com/lanej5/math).

### Research Highlights ðŸ§®ðŸ”¬

From grad school through several post docs, I did a decent amount of pure math research.

- My research centered on integrable systems in symplectic geometry, a topic that lies at the intersection of mathematical physics, Lie theory, and differential and algebraic geometry.
- My favourite research achievement is my paper on **Gradient-Hamiltonian vector fields.** Machine learning enthusiasts know about the *gradient*. Physics majors understand the *Hamiltonian*. Few know of the *gradient-Hamiltonian*, which is a special combination of both concepts. Ben Hoffman and I found some wonderful new applications of the gradient-Hamiltonian in geometry and mathematical physics by generalizing it to geometric spaces with singularities in our paper [Stratified Gradient Hamiltonian Vector Fields and Collective Integrable Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13656). 
- I've written many other papers with many lovely collaborators. You can find a complete list of my research publications and pre-prints on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lane_j_2.html).
