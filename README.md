### Data science and machine learning

My interest in data science started when I took Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization on Coursera back in 2018. Since then, I've worked on a few fun side projects to learn more:

- (Spring 2022) I created a [dashboard for the 2022 MLB postseason race](https://github.com/lanej5/mlb).
- (Spring 2022) I trained several [collaborative filtering models](https://lanej5.github.io/fastpages/recommender%20systems/collaborative%20filtering/2022/05/16/_05_16_handm.html) for the H&M clothing recommender system Kaggle competition.
- (Winter 2022) I coded up some [Monte-Carlo search tree AI agents for the chess variant Onitama](https://github.com/lanej5/onitamAI).
- (Summer 2021) I automated part of the quote-generation process for the Montreal based start-up Promenaid by deploying a MILP solver for the stock cutting problem.
- (2019) I built [restricted Boltzmann machines and deep autoencoders for computer vision](https://github.com/lanej5/bm) from scratch with numpy and gave [a presentation about energy-based probabilistic models](https://github.com/lanej5/bm/blob/master/slides.pdf) in the machine learning seminar at the University of Geneva (where I was a postdoc at the time).

As I prepare to make the leap from academia to industry I've also been working hard to level up my programming, stats, modelling, and data analysis / SQL skills. ðŸ’ª

I've started a humble [blog](https://lanej5.github.io/fastpages/).

### Teaching and Mentorship ðŸŽ“

I've taught 10 university math courses, led dozens of labs and tutorials, spoken in outreach seminars, and supervised successful student research projects. In total, I've worked with approximately 2500 students. I'm passionate about overcoming communication barriers and fostering deeper understanding of both technical concepts and each other. 

You can find some of my past [teaching materials on github](https://github.com/lanej5/math).

### Research Highlights ðŸ§®ðŸ”¬

I've done a decent amount of pure math research over the course of grad school and several post docs.

- My research centered on integrable systems in symplectic geometry, a topic that lies at the intersection of mathematical physics, Lie theory, and differential and algebraic geometry.
- My favourite research achievement is my paper on [Gradient-Hamiltonian vector fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13656). Machine learning enthusiasts know about the *gradient*. Physics majors understand the *Hamiltonian*. Few know of the *gradient-Hamiltonian*, which is a special combination of both concepts. Ben Hoffman and I found some wonderful new applications of the gradient-Hamiltonian in geometry and mathematical physics by generalizing it to geometric spaces with singularities. 
- I've written many other papers with many lovely collaborators. You can find a complete list of my research publications and pre-prints on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lane_j_2.html).
